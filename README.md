A package that allows control of the MiRo robot using an Xbox One controller.

To use, install the Python 2 version of pygame:
`sudo apt-get install python-pygame`

Run the controller by executing the bash script `./run.sh`.\
Feel free to run the python script `controller.py` directly, but note that your terminal will be flooded with pygame
 debugging messages, hence it's recommended you use the bash command instead.

Gamepad controls are as follows:\
Left stick = forward and reverse motion;\
Right stick = Steer left and right;\
Directional pad = Control MiRo's head pitch and yaw
